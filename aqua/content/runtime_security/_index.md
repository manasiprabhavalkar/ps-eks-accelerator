# Module 3: Secure the Workloads

Aqua provides various runtime enforcement controls to ensure a strong security posture in production when the build artifacts are converted into running workloads.

You can use runtime policies to monitor and enforce controls at runtime, according to your organizationâ€™s security requirements. These controls range from blocking unregistered images to detecting drift in a container, as well as granularly blocking certain behavior during runtime.

# Learning Objective
