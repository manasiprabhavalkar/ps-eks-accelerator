# Summary

Due to their immutable nature, container workloads are most likely an output of a CI/CD pipeline, where code flows only in one direction, from artifacts to full-fledged workloads running in production. Imagine a developer adding a new feature to his existing application and pushing out new container images. Aqua CSP helps him leverage the DevSecOps mindset to incorporate “security as code” by introducing a security gate in his DevOps workflow. Aqua scans his image during the build to uncover any vulnerabilities, malware as well as checks for any confidential data (PII) in the code. Thus the right flags can be raised right at the inception of the application where remediation is easier implement. In addition, for applications that are already running in production environments, which haven’t gone through the intense security scanning, Aqua can still secure by providing features like runtime enforcement, vShield and Microsegmentation. Within a code pipeline that flows from left to right, remediation happens on the left while mitigation happens on the right.
